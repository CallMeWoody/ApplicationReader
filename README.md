# ApplicationReader [DEPRECATED] 

This application was created 2013 / 2014 during my time of creating icon packs for Android. It helped a lot to get the relevant information of installed application to allow proper themeing of icons. 
The source code was cleaned up a bit, and made compiling with latest Android Studio 3.3, but it definitely contains a lot of old stuff. 

Publishing the source code open source to potentially help icon developers get the necessary details.
